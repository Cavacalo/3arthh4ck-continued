> :warning: YOU ARE CURRENTLY VIEWING THE BRANCH FOR 'BAREBONES' 3ARTHH4CK! This version has way less features than the regular one, including having PingBypass removed and having less testing, in order to 'de-bloat' or make the client overall simpler!

# 3arthh4ck - BareBones

This is the same thing as 3arthh4ck - but made simpler, and de-bloated. There is always downsides to having multiple branches, and for this one, it is that there is MUCH less development and testing done on this version, so expect to not have this working 100% of the time.

## Proxy/PingBypass
This version of 3arthh4ck has had PingBypass removed. You can find a version with PB still enabled if you change your branch to 'main'.
